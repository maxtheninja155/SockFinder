ðŸ‘‘ **First place project for [Hack the Wave]([https://www.hackthewave.com/](https://devpost.com/software/sock-finder))**

This is a website where you upload a picture of your sock, and it will find a different sock that matches the closest it can to your sock.
Using a Kaggle data set, we can connect your sock to a matching sock!
